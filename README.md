### Have you ever heard INCI?
INCI standards for International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients. INCI names are used in the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, and many other countries, for listing ingredients on cosmetic product labels. With few exceptions, the INCI labeling names in all countries are the same.

The skincare ingredients on INCIWIKI are written in INCI names.
